# cls-better
i got tired of typing in clear so i decided to make cls so i didn't have to type in an extra 2 letters





# building cls

make sure you have gcc, and type

<code>make</code>

into the console

boom.



# installing cls from source

type

<code>make install</code>

into the console

it will automatically build a new version and install it to your PATH.
